# README Datafiles

Folder: LOCOmotive/Datafiles

In this folder several data files are located.

The .csv-files are given by the RailNL-assignments/case. They are to be used in main.py. In Functions/helpers.py is a csv-reader function
to import these files into python. In this folder is a .png as well. This is a visualization of the default map of Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland.
Red nodes represent critical stations, blue nodes represent non-critical ones. Green dashed lines represent non-critical connections,
where solid black lines represent critical-connections. Also the station names and the weights of the connections are displayed.
