In this folder several algorithm functions are located.

They are imported by main.py to be used there. At this moment, there are two different functions of the Dijkstra algorithm.
The Dijkstra_V2 is a Dijkstra algorithm which looks a bit like an A*-algorithm since it uses a heuristic to compute the shortest path.
This heuristic is used to influence the order in the used priority queue.
