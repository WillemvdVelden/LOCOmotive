# README Algorithms

Folder: LOCOmotive/Algorithms

In this folder several algorithm functions are located.

They are imported by main.py to be used there. At this moment, there are two different functions of the Dijkstra algorithm.
The Dijkstra_V2 is a Dijkstra algorithm which looks a bit like an A*-algorithm since it uses a heuristic to compute the shortest path.
This heuristic is used to influence the order in the used priority queue.
