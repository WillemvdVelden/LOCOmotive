# README Concepts

Folder: LOCOmotive/Concepts

In this folder concepts for the RailNL-case are located.

These concepts where once part of the problem solving in main.py but now replaced by something else. At the moment there is graph.py,
in which a graph data structure is defined. Also several functions are defined to add nodes and/or edges to the graph.
In main.py this graph structure is replaced by the graph structure import from the package NetworkX.
